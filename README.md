### Hi there 👋

Python specialist, beginning a career in data science; reach out for help, collabaration or advice 😀 🐍 

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 📫 How to reach me: j.d.ward001@googlemail.com
Outside of github you can catch travelling, sporting or with my head stuck in a book; all while drinking too much coffee ☕️
